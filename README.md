# PhysarumSlimeSimulation

Nature simulation written in Java with the Processing library

### Description

After reading a paper on Physarum slime written by [Jeff Jones](https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/980579) I decided to make a moving Agent simulation drawing on charactersisits as written in the paper. The Agents move fully autonomously, like Physarum, around their environment moving based on the trail of other Agents.
